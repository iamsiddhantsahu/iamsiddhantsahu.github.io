                   holistic understanding of various architectures that have
                   evolved over the past few years to solve blind deblurring.
                   The introductory work used deep learning to estimate some
                   features of the blur kernel and then moved onto predicting
                   the blur kernel entirely, which converts the problem into
                   non-blind deblurring. The recent state of the art techniques
                   are end to end, i.e., they don't estimate the blur kernel
                   rather try to estimate the latent sharp image directly from
                   the blurred image. The benchmarking PSNR and SSIM values on
                   standard datasets of GOPRO and Kohler using various
                   architectures are also provided.",
